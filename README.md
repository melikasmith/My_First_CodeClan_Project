My Brief

Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.

MVP:
The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
Each country should have one or more cities to visit.
There should be a button that returns the user to a list of countries.

Extensions:
The user could be able to create and edit countries.
Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit.
Search for destination by continent, city or country.

Terminal Commands:
python3 console.py - run console.py
python3 -m flask run - run flask
psql -d travel_bucketlist -f db/travel_bucketlist.sql - run sql file
psql travel_bucketlist - run psql travel_bucketlist
